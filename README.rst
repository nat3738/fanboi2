Fanboi2
=======

Board engine behind `Fanboi Channel <http://fanboi.ch/>`_ written in Python.

Getting Started
---------------

The Better Way
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We use `Vagrant <http://www.vagrantup.com/>`_ for development environment provisioning. You must first `install Vagrant <http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/installation/>`_ (and `VirtualBox <https://www.virtualbox.org/>`_ or any other available `providers <http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/providers/index.html>`_) and run the following commands::

    $ vagrant box add precise64 http://files.vagrantup.com/precise64.box
    $ vagrant up

That's it! You can now visit http://localhost:8080/ and proceed on development. After you've done, you can now run either ``vagrant destroy`` to completely remove the VM or ``vagrant halt`` to shutdown the VM. See also `Teardown <http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/getting-started/teardown.html>`_ section of Vagrant documentation.

The Adventurous Way
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you don't want to use Vagrant (oh you sadistic), you can manually install everything, including:

- `Python 3.2 <http://www.python.org/>`_
- `PostgreSQL 9.1 <http://www.postgresql.org/>`_
- `Redis <http://redis.io>`_
- `node.js <http://nodejs.org>`_ with `brunch <http://brunch.io/>`_

After all prerequisites are installed, you can now create the database, run setup and seed the database::

    $ createuser -P fanboi2  # Set "dev" as password.
    $ createdb -O fanboi2 fanboi2_dev
    $ python setup.py develop
    $ alembic upgrade head

It is recommended to run tests and see if all tests passed. Before doing so, you must first create the ``fanboi2_test`` database::

    $ createdb -O fanboi2 fanboi2_test
    $ pip install nose
    $ nosetests

If all tests passed, you can now run the application. You must first setup assets compilation and do an initial compile before running::

    $ npm install
    $ brunch build
    $ pserve development.ini --reload

You may also found ``brunch watch`` useful for automatic assets compilation::

    $ brunch watch

Management Scripts
------------------

We currently uses CLI to manage board settings. If you use Vagrant, you will need to SSH into the development box and run the following commands before begin::

    $ vagrant ssh
    $ cd /vagrant
    $ source /usr/local/venv/fanboi2/bin/activate

After you've setup the environment, the first thing you want to do is to create a new board::

    $ fb2_create_board development.ini --title Lounge --slug lounge
    $ fb2_create_board development.ini --title Demo --slug demo

Above commands will create a board named "Lounge" and "Demo" at ``/lounge`` and ``/demo`` respectively. Now if you want to update something such as description, you can now do::

    $ fb2_update_board development.ini -s lounge -f description

Slug is used here to identify which board to edit. All database fields in board are editable this way. Some field, such as ``settings`` must be a **valid JSON**. Both commands also accepts ``--help`` which will display some available options.

Contributing
------------

We use `git-flow <https://github.com/nvie/gitflow>`_ as primary branching model. All developments are done in the **develop** branch; **master** branch is the most stable and will be deployed immediately to the live site. You can install ``git-flow`` by following `git-flow installation instructions <https://github.com/nvie/gitflow/wiki/Installation>`_ (use the default values). To contribute, you must:

1. Fork this repo.
2. Start a new feature with ``git flow feature start feature-name``.
3. After you've done, open a pull request against **develop** branch of this repo.

Please make sure that test coverage is 100% and everything passed. It's also a good idea to open a bug ticket for feature you want to implement before starting.
